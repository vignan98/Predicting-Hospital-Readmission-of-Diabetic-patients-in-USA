# Predicting-Hospital-Readmission-of-Diabetic-patients-in-USA
## Introduction & Aim of the Project
The Data considered for this project : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008
The main intention to choose Healthcare data is to understand the characteristics and importance of each feature in the dataset and how better models can be built using the right set of data. Around 7% of the population worldwide are suffering with Diabetes. It is a chronic disease characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose which increases the risk of stroke by 1.8 times, increases the mortality rate by 1.8 times when compared to undiagnosed diabetic patients. We will be determining the readmission of patients to the hospitals after their medication during the first visit. Our aim is to understand the data and focus on EDA which is an important step that consumes most of the time and effort in any Data Science Project. Having the right set of data will help to develop robust algorithms. As we learned ‘No Free Lunch Theorem’, which states No single Machine Learning Algorithm is the best solution for all problems, we wish to explore the data and try different types of classification algorithms to find out the best fit algorithm.
